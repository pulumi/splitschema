You can find a complete list of supported values in the [AWS WAF API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_SizeConstraint.html#WAF-Type-SizeConstraint-TextTransformation).\n**Note:** If you choose `BODY` as the `type`, you must also choose `NONE` because CloudFront only forwards the first 8192 bytes for inspection.\n"
