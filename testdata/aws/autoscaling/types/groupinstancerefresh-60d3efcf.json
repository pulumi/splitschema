Additional properties can be specified in the `triggers` property of `instance_refresh`.\n\n\u003e **NOTE:** A refresh will not start when `version = \"$Latest\"` is configured in the `launch_template` block. To trigger the instance refresh when a launch template is changed, configure `version` to use the `latest_version` attribute of the `aws.ec2.LaunchTemplate` resource.\n\n\u003e **NOTE:** Auto Scaling Groups support up to one active instance refresh at a time. When this resource is updated, any existing refresh is cancelled.\n\n\u003e **NOTE:** Depending on health check settings and group size, an instance refresh may take a long time or fail.
