Data source for managing an AWS ECS (Elastic Container) Task Execution. This data source calls the [RunTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html) API, allowing execution of one-time tasks that don't fit a standard resource lifecycle. See the feature request issue for additional context.

> **NOTE on preview operations:** This data source calls the `RunTask` API on every read operation, which means new task(s) may be created from a `pulumi preview` command if all attributes are known. Placing this functionality behind a data source is an intentional trade off to enable use cases requiring a one-time task execution without relying on provisioners. Caution should be taken to ensure the data source is only executed once, or that the resulting tasks can safely run in parallel.
